📝 Project Description (README)

This project is an interactive Power BI MIS dashboard created to analyze SDC and Champion Club sales performance for January 2026.
The dashboard helps management track monthly business volume (BV), identify top performers, monitor pending BV, and analyze gender-wise user distribution using dynamic visuals and slicers.

The report is designed with a clean layout, interactive filters, and optimized DAX calculations to support quick decision-making.
